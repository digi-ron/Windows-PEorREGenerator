# Windows-PEorREGenerator
(Abandonned due to better "off the shelf" solutions and legal ambiguity) a simple set of scripts to create a Windows PE or Windows RE based image

## Instructions
1. modify anything you'd like to change in the System32_UserDefined folder, example files are included for running programs on startup of the image
1. modify the included batch files to install the packages you'd like. Examples are in there already
1. run the scripts according to what image you'd like to generate

_NOTE: this solution is kind of janky and was the result of my own investigation into making a repair image with my own selection of programs on it. I'm not adding anything else to this repo as I found better ways to make the image made by people smarter than I am, and a better pre-made image with close enough to what I needed anyways_
